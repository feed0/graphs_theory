# 4th semester Graphs Theory assessment

## GraphMatrix
An adjacency matrix based data structure to provide relationship between vertices on a given graph.
Graphs supported are simple, so there are no parallel or loop edges.
It can be either a Digraph or a non-directed graph.

## Methods
<ul>
    <li>Complete graph: iterates through every edge. Returns false in case there's not an edge in between two vertices.</li>
    <li>Isomorphism</li>
    <li>Range search</li>
    <li>Shortest paths</li>
    <li>Min spanning tree</li>
</ul>
