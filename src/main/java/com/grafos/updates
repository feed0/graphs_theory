ADD boolean isDirected, isWeighted and setMatrixType
FIX constructors (random matrix and input matrix) - now automatically set their matrixType
FIX randomize() - now iterates always through the LOWER TRIANGLE (instead of the whole matrix)
FIX matrixType - now concerns 4 types of matrices (instead of 2) inclding weighted ones.
